<h3>Secure your secrets</h3>
<h4>WHY</h4>
<p>When using a web site, you will normally have references to external dependencies. These dependencies could be things like databases, external systems or other.</p>
<p>The way these things is usually connected to each other is via connection strings or secret tokens. A common way of handling those secrets is by adding them to web.config or even hard coding them in the code.</p>
<p>Even though both are valid ways of handling it, none of them are secure. Should a stranger gain access to your source code, the will be able to get those secrets and misuse them.</p>
<p>Further, using the same connectionstring or secret across multiple applications, will make it hard to update those secrets, as you'd have to update them in each application that utilizes it.
<h4>WHAT</h4>
<p>Azure Key Vault is a service that gives you a repository in the Cloud, to store secrets in a secure way. You can see it as a key-value store, where access to the store is managed by Azure</p>
<p>Having a centralized store, enables all your applications to reuse the same secrets, further access to those secrets can now be limited to only a subset of people in an organization.</p>
<p>The task in exercise is to swap out some hardcoded secrets with the same secrets, stored in a Azure Key Vault.</p>
